Feature: fileUpload
  In order write BDD tests
  As a developer
  I want to set the value of file input elements

  Scenario: Set a file input element value
    Given the url "http://localhost:3000/fileUpload.html" is opened
    When  I set the file element "input[type='file']" value to "./test/screenshots/ref/ccc-landing.png"
    Then  I expect the element "input[type='file']" value is "C:\fakepath\ccc-landing.png"
